Analyis steps:
---------------

0. [BEN] Data normalization and formatting fort Affymetrix and RNA-Seq gene expressions

1. [BEN] Compute pairwise correlation between Affy and illumina RNA-seq by
 
(a) Selecting the best Affy probesets using jetset;
(b) Selecting the most correlated probesets;
(c) Use the isoform expression FPKMs and compare then with the most similar probesets
 
    *   Test whether selecting the most correlated probeset per gene or the most correlated pair (probeset, transcript) is dramatically improving the correlation distribution
    *   Plot, for each patient, the expression values as measured by Affy and RNA-Seq; this will help showing that the dynamic range of RNAseq is better than the one of microarray for low expression genes
    *	From the correlation distribution, classify the well and poorly correlated genes
 
 2. [BEN] Compare breast cancer gene expression signatures computed from Affymetrix and Illumina RNA-seq data. For the Affy signatures, use the probesets or the RNA-seq data and compute signature scores and classification, and compare them;
 
 3. [BEN] For the non-affy signatures, compute the score and classification using either the jetset or the most correlated probeset
 
    *   Add the DCN, STROMA CD10, TOP2 INDEX to the pool of signatures;
 
 4. [NORMAN] Compute and plot correlation between signature scores; try to use the "MEAS" plot;
 
 5. [NORMAN] Check whether large gene signatures are always more correlated, do a random selection of genes of increasing size;
 
6. [TEAM WORK] Find the reasons why some gene are poorly correlated. Start with some genes of interest (ESR1, ERBB2, PLAU, STAT1)
    *   level of expression [BEN]
    *   alternative splicing, using bioMart or the website Christine mentioned [DEBORA]
http://www.as3d.org/human2006/
 
    *   Mappability [VINCENT, ?]
    *   association with gene lengths using the genomcfeatures package [NORMAN]
 
 7.  [DEBORA] Write the paper
 
 8. [NORMAN] Submit the Affymetrix data and clinical information to GEO; ask GEO folks if they want us to append the RNA-Seq FPKM as a supplementary file or if they prefer we create a new series for the RNA-Seq FPKM

 9.  Optional analyses: association of gene and isoform FPKMs with subtypes and survival -> not enough data
 
 10. [NORMAN] Retrieve and analyze TCGA data
