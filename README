1.  Compute pairwise correlation between Affy and illumine RNA-seq by
1.  Compute pairwise correlation between Affy and illumina RNA-seq by
 
(i) Selecting the best Affy probesets using jetset;
(ii) Selecting the most correlated probesets;
(iii) Use the isoform expression FPKMs and compare then with the most similar probesets
 
    *   Test whether selecting the most correlated probeset per gene or the most correlated pair (probeset, transcript) is dramatically improving the correlation distribution
    *   Plot, for each patient, the expression values as measured by Affy and RNA-Seq; this will help showing that the dynamic range of RNAseq is better than the one of microarray for low expression genes
 
 2.  For the Affy signatures, use the probesets or the RNA-seq data and compute signature scores and classification, and compare them;
 
 3.  For the non-affy signatures, compute the score and classification using either the jetset or the most correlated probeset
 
    *   Add the DCN, STROMA CD10, TOP2 INDEX to the pool of signatures;
 
 4.  Compute and plot correlation between signature scores; try to use the "MEAS" plot (see papers in attachment);
 
 5.  Check whether large gene signatures are always more correlated, do a random selection of genes of increasing size;
 
 6.  From the correlation distribution, classify the well and poorly correlated genes;
 
 
7.  Find the reasons why some gene are poorly correlated. Start with some genes of interest (ESR1, ERBB2, PLAU, STAT1)
    *   level of expression
    *   alternative splicing, using bioMart or the website Christine mentioned
http://www.as3d.org/human2006/
 
    *   Mappability (Vincent)
    *   association with gene lengths
 
 8.  Write the paper
 
 9.  Optional analyses: association of gene and isoform FPKMs with subtypes and survival -> not enough data
 
 10. Retrieve and analyze TCGA data
